### Abstract
This research examines the risks posed by quantum computing to classical cryptography, focusing on protecting electronic communications using Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Through literature review, expert surveys, and performance benchmarking, the study evaluates the effectiveness, scalability, and integration of these approaches. Results indicate that QKD offers high security but limited scalability, while PQC is easier to integrate but may impact performance. A hybrid approach combining QKD and PQC provides a practical and resilient solution for long-term cybersecurity.
